Poster to be presented at the 2023 Mathematical Society Conference.

Files:

* `hpmp.R`: My own *High Precision MultiPlot* package. Allows for easy manipulation of multiplots. The idea is the poster is just a very large `R` plot with a bunch of insets in it.
* `poster_MathPsych2023.R`: `R` code that generates the final `.pdf`.
* `poster_MathPsych2023.pdf`: Final product.
